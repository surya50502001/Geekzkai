# TODO: Fix Hamburger Menu to Open Side Menu Bar

- [x] Modify the menu div in Navbar.jsx to transform into a side-sliding menu from the left
- [x] Update positioning from absolute dropdown to fixed overlay with full height and set width (e.g., w-64)
- [x] Add smooth slide-in/slide-out animation using Tailwind transitions (translate-x-0 when open, translate-x-full when closed)
- [x] Remove md:hidden to allow side menu on all screen sizes (or adjust based on user feedback)
- [x] Ensure high z-index for overlay and add close-on-click outside if needed
- [x] Update button and menu to handle closing on menu item clicks or outside clicks for better UX
- [ ] Test the changes (without running frontend as per user)
